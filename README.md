## Rotating Navigation

This is an HTML and CSS code for a rotating navigation menu. The navigation menu is hidden initially, and clicking on the circle button with the three bars icon will reveal the menu with a rotation animation. The X button will close the menu with another rotation animation. The page has a container with some content and an image, and a fixed navigation menu at the bottom of the page.
